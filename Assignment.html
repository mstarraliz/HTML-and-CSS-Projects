	<p>Here is a quote from the National Geographic website:</p>
	
	<blockquote cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/d/domestic-dog/index.html">
	Domestic dogs still share many behaviors with their wild relatives. Both defend their territories and mark them by urinating on trees, rocks, fence posts, and other suitable sites. These scent posts serve notice to other dogs that an animal is occupying its territory.
	Many pet dogs also bury bones or favorite toys for future use, just as their wild relatives sometimes bury a kill to secure the meat for later feasts.
